## Homework
### Multiplication Table
Write a program that prints multiplication table.

Expected output:

    1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	
    2	4	6	8	10	12	14	16	18	
    3	6	9	12	15	18	21	24	27	
    4	8	12	16	20	24	28	32	36	
    5	10	15	20	25	30	35	40	45	
    6	12	18	24	30	36	42	48	54	
    7	14	21	28	35	42	49	56	63	
    8	16	24	32	40	48	56	64	72	
    9	18	27	36	45	54	63	72	81

### Power
Calculating power is one of the base operations in mathematics.

We can calculate a power operation with a single loop, with multiply the number exponent times.

For example 2^4 = (2 * 2 * 2 *2 ) is just multiplying 2, 4 times.

Make a program that calculates the given power of given base number.

Example input/output:

    Enter a base number: 5
    Enter an exponent: 4
    5 ^ 4 = 625

### Palindrome Numbers
Lets make a good example with working a number in a different way.

An palindrome number is a number that the reverse of that number is equal to the original number.

So we need to reverse a number and check if it is equal to its reverse.

We can make it with a loop, and every step of loop, we can take the last digit of original number and add it to reversed numbers last digit.


__Hint:__ We can use "remainder = n % 10" expression for take the last digit (Not hint for how to add it to reversed number)

Example input/output:

    Enter an integer: 12321 
    12321 is a palindrome.
